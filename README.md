# Colorado Housing Dashboard

Welcome to my Colorado Housing Dashboard project! This project is a web-based dashboard application built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), using data from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS) 1-year and 5-year estimates, which provide detailed population, income, and housing information.

## Features
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Explore and compare data through maps, graphs, and other visual tools.
- **Real-time Data**: This dashboard is fed by the Census Bureau's APIs, enabling accurate, up-to-date access to housing data.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface with intuitive controls and ADA-compliant visualizations.
- **Open Access**: The code and dashboard are publicly available, and all charts and tables can be exported by any user.

## Term Sheet
To ensure a clear understanding of the housing data presented in this dashboard, we have included a term sheet. This term sheet explains common housing data terms used by the Census, such as "housing burden," which refers to spending more than 30% of oneâ€™s income on housing. These definitions will help you better interpret the data and insights provided by the dashboard.

1. **Contract Rent:** The monthly rental cost specified in a lease agreement, excluding other rental costs like utilities.
2. **Gross Rent:** Contract rent plus other rental costs like utilities, used to calculate housing burden.
3. **Housing Burdened:** A household is said to be housing burdened when it spends more than 30% of its income on housing.
4. **Tenure:** Refers to whether a housing unit is owner-occupied or renter-occupied.

## Screenshots
Below is a preview of the kinds of visualizations you will find in this dashboard:
